###### Methods
```_get_callback(self, process_key, callback_dict)```<br>
```process_key```: string, *lookup key for callback function*
```callback_dict```: dict, *rules and callbacks for data processing*

*Value of `process_key` looks ups up to key in `callback_dict`with value of a callback function. Looks up & returns callback function in `callback_dict` corresponding to value of `process_key`.*
<br>Returns: *callback function* (function)

```process_data(data)```<Br>
```data```: dict, input data
